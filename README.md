Welcome to the ECU CAN Signal Simulation repo! This project is all about simulating CAN signals in an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) environment using MATLAB. Weâ€™ve packed this script with advanced signal processing, control systems, and real-time data visualization to make it as robust and useful as possible for anyone working with embedded systems and electronics.

## Features

- **Signal Generation**: Mixes sine wave, square wave, and Gaussian noise for a realistic signal.
- **Signal Processing**: Uses a low-pass Butterworth filter to clean up the signal.
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Applies Fourier Transform to break down the signal into its frequency components.
- **RMS Calculation**: Computes the Root Mean Square to measure signal power.
- **PID Controller**: Implements a PID controller to mimic control systems in ECUs.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Updates a 3D plot dynamically to show the signal components over time.
- **CAN Message Simulation**: Constructs and prints out simulated CAN messages for a bit of realism.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/evielm9awda/ecu
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd ECU-CAN-Signal-Simulation
    ```

3. **Run the MATLAB script**:
    Open [`can.m`](https://github.com/evielm9awda/ecu/blob/main/can.m) in MATLAB and hit run. Sit back and watch the magic happen.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB R2020b or later.
